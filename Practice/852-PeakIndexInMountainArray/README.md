You are given an integer mountain array arr of length n where the values increase to a peak element and then decrease.

Return the index of the peak element.

Your task is to solve it in O(log(n)) time complexity.

 

Example 1:

Input: arr = [0,1,0]

Output: 1


Example 2:

Input: arr = [0,2,1,0]

Output: 1


Example 3:

Input: arr = [0,10,5,2]

Output: 1

 

Constraints:

3 <= arr.length <= 105
0 <= arr[i] <= 106
arr is guaranteed to be a mountain array.
